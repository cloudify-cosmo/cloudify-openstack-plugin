1.5:
    - Create project, assign existing users with roles and customize quotas.
    - Create image from file (local workflow only) or url.
    - Add conditional creation to all resources. Create a resource only if it doesn't already exist. Previously, could
      either use an existing resource, or create it.
    - Boot server from volume. Support boot from block storage and not only from image like in previous versions.
    - Fix connect port to security group race-condition.
    - Get mac address from port after creation.
    - Raise error also when external network is missing in floating ip creation. Previously, an error was raised only
      when floating network id or name was missing.
