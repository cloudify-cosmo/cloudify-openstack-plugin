2.0.1:
    - Don't overwrite server['image'] when server is booted from volume
    - Fix loading auth_url from environment (OPENSTACK-101)
    - Raise an error if server is not attached to a network. Previously an IndexError would be raised.
    - Fix attempt to access `volume.display_name` (is now .name) (OPENSTACK-108)
    - Correctly handle nova_url and neutron_url in openstack_configuration (these are deprecated) (OPENSTACK-109)
2.0:
    - Don't require a Server image to be specified if a boot_volume is attached
    - Add support for keystone auth v3. auth_url setting must now include version
    - Upgraded openstack library dependencies
    - Use availability_zone from connected boot_volume if Server doesn't specify
    - Embed full docs in plugin repo. Now using sphinxify sphinx extension
1.5:
    - Create project, assign existing users with roles and customize quotas.
    - Create image from file (local workflow only) or url.
    - Add conditional creation to all resources. Create a resource only if it doesn't already exist. Previously, could
      either use an existing resource, or create it.
    - Boot server from volume. Support boot from block storage and not only from image like in previous versions.
    - Fix connect port to security group race-condition.
    - Get mac address from port after creation.
    - Raise error also when external network is missing in floating ip creation. Previously, an error was raised only
      when floating network id or name was missing.
