      availability_zone:

          The availability zone from which to launch the server.
          When you provision resources, you specify from which availability
          zone you want your instance to be built. Typically,
          an admin user will use availability zones to arrange
          OpenStack compute hosts into logical groups.
          An availability zone provides a form of physical isolation
          and redundancy from other availability zones.
          For instance, if some racks in your data center are
          on a separate power source, you can put servers in those racks
          in their own availability zone. Availability zones can
          also help separate different classes of hardware.
          By segregating resources into availability zones,
          you can ensure that your application resources are spread across
          disparate machines to achieve high availability
          in the event of hardware or other failure.
          You can list the available availability zones
          by calling the os-availability-zone API,
          but you should avoid using the default availability zone when
          booting the instance. In general,

           example, cinder- volume.ubuntu.lvmdriver. When a volume is

           the request based on the volume type. Default is None. For

          The device name this volume will be attached to.
          Default value is *auto*,
          which means openstack will auto-assign a device.
          Note that if you do explicitly set a value,
          this value may not be the actual device name assigned.
          Sometimes the device requested will not be available and openstack will assign it to a different device,
          this is why we recommend using *auto*.
